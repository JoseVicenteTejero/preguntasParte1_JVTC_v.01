Explanation: <br>
* Despite the improvements in JavaScript engines, it is not uncommon for users to encounter frozen user <br>
interfaces as the browser works through resource intensive tasks. This leads to a horrible user experience. <br>
The purpose of Web Workers is to give developers a way of instructing the browser to process large tasks <br>
in the background; therefore preventing the UI from freezing up. <br>
* The Web Workers specification defines an API for spawning background scripts in your web application. <br>
Web Workers allow you to do things like fire up long-running scripts to handle computationally intensive <br>

tasks, but without blocking the UI or other scripts to handle user interactions <br>
