            You are creating a rotating image of a company logo.
            The logo must spin on a horizontal axis and on a vertical axis.
            You need to use the least amount of development effort to meet the requirement.

            What should you do?

            A. Create an Image Spinner object, load the image into the spinner, and set the horizontal and vertical
            rotation properties.
            B. Create a Canvas Globe transform and set the image as the globe object. Set the horizontal and vertical
            rotation properties.
            C. Create a single Canvas 3D transform and load the image into it. Set the rotation properties.
            D. Create a Canvas 2D transform and set the image to rotate horizontally and vertically.

            Correct Answer: C - ES LA FORMA MÁS SENCILLA DE REALIZAR LO PEDIDO. EXPLICACIÓN ABAJO.

            Explanation/Reference:
            Explanation:
            CSS3 allows you to format your elements using 3D transforms.
            There are two 3D transform methods:
            rotateX() - With the rotateX() method, the element rotates around its X-axis at a given degree.
            rotateY() - With the rotateY() method, the element rotates around its Y-axis at a given degree.
